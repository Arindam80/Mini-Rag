## Overview

This project is a comprehensive implementation of a modern RAG pipeline, built as part of an AI Engineer assessment. It features a sleek, responsive frontend and a powerful Python backend. A user can paste any block of text, which is then chunked, embedded, and stored in a vector database. Subsequently, the user can ask questions, and the system will retrieve the most relevant context, rerank it for accuracy, and use a powerful LLM to generate a grounded answer with citations to the original source text.

## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Document Ingestion:** Accepts any block of text and processes it for querying in real-time.
* **Advanced RAG Pipeline:** Implements a state-of-the-art Retrieve-Rerank-Generate pipeline for high-quality, relevant answers.
* **Cited & Grounded Answers:** The LLM is instructed to answer *only* from the provided context and to cite its sources, significantly reducing hallucinations.
* **Modern & Responsive UI:** A sleek, dark-themed frontend built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides a great user experience with smooth animations.
* **Separated Frontend/Backend Deployment:** Follows industry best practices by deploying the static frontend to Vercel and the stateful backend service to Render.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Tech Stack

The application follows a decoupled architecture, with the frontend and backend hosted on separate, specialized platforms.

**Data Flow:**
`Frontend (Vercel) -> Backend API (Render) -> RAG Pipeline -> [Qdrant -> Cohere -> Groq] -> Response`

**Key Providers & Technologies:**

| Component | Technology/Provider | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript | User Interface & API Communication |
| **Backend** | Python 3.11, FastAPI | API Logic & RAG Orchestration |
| **Frontend Hosting** | Vercel | Global CDN for a fast static site |
| **Backend Hosting** | Render | Service hosting for the Python application |
| **Vector Database**| **Qdrant Cloud** | Storing Text Embeddings |
| **Embeddings** | **Cohere** (`embed-english-v3.0`) | Converting Text to Vectors |
| **Reranker** | **Cohere** (`rerank-english-v3.0`) | Improving relevance of retrieved documents |
| **LLM** | **Groq** (Llama3 `llama3-8b-8192`) | Generating the final answer |
| **Orchestration** | LangChain | Connecting all AI components |

### Index Configuration

* **Vector Database:** Qdrant Cloud
* **Embedding Model:** Cohere (`embed-english-v3.0`)
* **Vector Dimensionality:** **1024**

## ⚙️ Local Setup

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
* Git
* Python 3.10+
* A code editor like VS Code with the "Live Server" extension.

### 1. Clone & Setup Backend
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AditRajSrivastava/mini_rag.git
cd mini_rag

# Set up the Python environment
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On MacOS/Linux
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create your environment file from the example
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, open the `backend/.env` file and add your secret API keys from Qdrant, Cohere, and Groq.

### 2. Run the Backend Server
```bash
# From the backend/ directory, start the API server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The backend will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

### 3. Run the Frontend Server
1. Open the project's root folder (`mini_rag`) in VS Code.
2. Right-click on the `public/index.html` file.
3. Select "Open with Live Server".
4. Your browser will open the application, ready to communicate with your local backend.

## 🎯 Evaluation

The RAG pipeline was tested on several texts to evaluate its accuracy, citation capability, and robustness.

**Test Case 1: Tech History**
*Context Provided:*
"The resurgence of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is largely thanks to breakthroughs in deep learning. After a period of reduced funding and interest known as the "AI winter," progress began to accelerate in the 2000s..."

*Question:* What was the name of the deep neural network that won the ImageNet challenge in 2012?

✅ **Result:** "The name of the deep neural network that won the ImageNet challenge in 2012 was AlexNet, created by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. [1]"

*Analysis:* Correctly retrieved the specific name and associated entities from the text.

**Test Case 2: Scientific Facts**
*Context Provided:*
"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the most powerful space telescope ever built, launched in December 2021..."

*Question:* Who is the lead scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope project?

✅ **Result:** "I do not have enough information to answer this question."

*Analysis:* Correctly identified that the answer was not in the provided context, successfully avoiding hallucination.

## 📋 Remarks (Limitations & Future Work)

### Limitations
- **Single Document Context:** The application currently handles a single pasted text at a time. It does not support file uploads or multiple documents.
- **No Chat History:** Each query is independent. The model does not remember previous questions in a conversation.
- **API Rate Limits:** The application relies on the free tiers of various services, which come with rate limits that could affect performance in a high-traffic scenario.

### Future Work
- **File Uploads:** Implement support for uploading `.pdf`, `.txt`, and `.md` files to make the application more versatile.
- **Chat Interface:** Convert the Q&A format to a conversational chat interface with memory, allowing for follow-up questions.
- **Streaming Responses:** Stream the LLM response token by token to the frontend to improve the perceived performance and user experience.
